Hi, I’m Murat Bir.

I’m an IT Project Manager with a Computer Science background and over five years of experience delivering enterprise-scale systems across government, consulting, and financial services.

I currently work within Infrastructure Technology Services (ITS) at the Ontario Public Service, leading complex infrastructure and identity-related initiatives. Previously, I’ve worked at organizations such as CIBC, CGI, and Treasury Board Secretariat, supporting modernization efforts in cybersecurity, billing systems, and vendor platforms.

I’m particularly interested in roles that sit at the intersection of **technology, delivery, and product thinking**.
